# Markdown and code

This is a paragraph with some **bold** and _italic_ text.

* this
* is
* a
* list

#### file.js
```javascript
const foo = 42;

```

Below is an HTML comment followed by a codeblock that we shouldn't parse as a code cell.
<!-- srcbook: {"markdown": "no parse"} -->
```typescript
const foo = 42;
console.log(foo);

const bar = foo;
return foo;
```

This is some more text, should be a second markdown block

#### otherfile.js
```javascript
const thisIsCool = true;
```

We finish with a **flurry**!
