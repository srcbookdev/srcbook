# Srcbook

Srcbooks are interactive notebooks for JavaScript & TypeScript. They allow you to create, run and share reproduceable programs and ideas.

Srcbooks export to a `.srcmd` format, a superset of markdown.

## Requirements

Srcbook requires node v22+. We highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage local node versions.

## Install

You can install the `srcbook` application from `npm`:

```
npm install -g srcbook
```

And then run it:

```
srcbook
```

You can also run it directly using `npx`:

```
# Using npx
npx srcbook

# Using pnpm
pnpm dlx srcbook
```
