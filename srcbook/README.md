# Srcbook

JavaScript and TypeSript notebooks.

This application allows you to create, run, and share Srcbooks. Srcbooks are JavaScript or TypeScript notebooks that use the node runtime and run locally on your machine. Srcbooks export to markdown using the `.src.md` extension. These files can easily be shared, versioned, and rendered in any environment that supports Markdown, like your editor or GitHub UI.

## Run

### Global install

```bash
# Install
npm install -g srcbook

# Run the application
srcbook
```
