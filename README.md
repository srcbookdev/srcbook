## Analytics and tracking

In order to improve Srcbook, we collect some behavioral analytics. We don't collect any Personal Identifiable Information (PII), our goals are simply to improve the application. The code is open source so you don't have to trust us, you can verify! You can find more information in our [privacy policy](./PRIVACY-POLICY.md).

If you want to disable tracking, you can run Srcbook with `SRCBOOK_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=true` set in the environment.
