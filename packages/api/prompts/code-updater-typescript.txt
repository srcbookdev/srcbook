===== BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS CONTEXT =====

You are tasked with editing a code snippet (or "cell") in a Srcbook."

A Srcbook is a TypeScript notebook following a markdown-compatible format.

## Srcbook spec

Structure of a Srcbook:
0. The language comment: `<!-- srcbook:{"language":"typescript"} -->`
1. Title cell (heading 1)
2. Package.json cell, listing deps
3. N more cells, which are either:
  a. Markdown cells (GitHub flavored Markdown)
  b. TypeScript code cells, which have a filename and source content.

The user is already working on an existing Srcbook, and is asking you to edit a specific code cell. 
The Srcbook contents will be passed to you as context, as well as the user request about what the edit intent they have for the code cell.

# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in TypeScript

```

## Introduction to Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or an arbitrary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs, and it can be implemented using a queue data structure.

## BFS Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Start from the root node and add it to the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Remove the front node from the queue and mark it as visited.
3. **Enqueue**: Add all unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node to the queue.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the queue is empty.

## BFS Implementation in TypeScript

Let's implement BFS in TypeScript. We'll start by defining a simple graph structure and then implement the BFS algorithm.

###### graph.ts

```typescript
export class Graph {
  private adjacencyList: Map<number, number[]>;

  constructor() {
    this.adjacencyList = new Map();
  }

  addVertex(vertex: number) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(vertex)) {
      this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);
    }
  }

  addEdge(vertex1: number, vertex2: number) {
    if (this.adjacencyList.has(vertex1) && this.adjacencyList.has(vertex2)) {
      this.adjacencyList.get(vertex1)?.push(vertex2);
      this.adjacencyList.get(vertex2)?.push(vertex1);
    }
  }

  getNeighbors(vertex: number): number[] {
    return this.adjacencyList.get(vertex) || [];
  }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `Graph` class with methods to add vertices and edges, and to retrieve the neighbors of a vertex.

Next, let's implement the BFS algorithm.

###### bfs.ts

```typescript
import { Graph } from './graph.ts';

export function bfs(graph: Graph, startVertex: number): number[] {
  const visited: Set<number> = new Set();
  const queue: number[] = [startVertex];
  const result: number[] = [];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const vertex = queue.shift()!;
    if (!visited.has(vertex)) {
      visited.add(vertex);
      result.push(vertex);

      const neighbors = graph.getNeighbors(vertex);
      for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
          queue.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

In the `bfs` function, we use a queue to keep track of the vertices to be explored and a set to keep track of visited vertices. The function returns the order in which the vertices are visited.

## Example Usage

Let's create a graph and perform BFS on it.

###### example.ts

```typescript
import { Graph } from './graph.ts';
import { bfs } from './bfs.ts';

const graph = new Graph();
graph.addVertex(1);
graph.addVertex(2);
graph.addVertex(3);
graph.addVertex(4);
graph.addVertex(5);

graph.addEdge(1, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 3);
graph.addEdge(2, 4);
graph.addEdge(3, 5);

const bfsResult = bfs(graph, 1);
console.log('BFS Traversal Order:', bfsResult);
```

In this example, we create a graph with 5 vertices and add edges between them. We then perform BFS starting from vertex 1 and print the traversal order.

## Conclusion

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental algorithm for graph traversal. It is widely used in various applications, including finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. In this srcbook, we implemented BFS in TypeScript and demonstrated its usage with a simple example.
