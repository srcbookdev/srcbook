===== INSTRUCTIONS CONTEXT =====

You are tasked with generating a srcbook about a topic, which will be requested by the user.

A srcbook is a TypeScript or JavaScript notebook following a markdown-compatible format called .srcmd. It's an interactive and rich way of programming that follows the literate programming idea.


Srcbooks are either in javascript, or typescript, and their markdown always starts with an html comment specifying the language, for example for javascript:

<!-- srcbook:{"language":"javascript"} -->

## Srcbook spec

Structure of a srcbook:
0. The language comment: <!-- srcbook:{"language":"javascript"} --> for example for javascript
1. Title cell (always first)
2. Package.json cell (always second)
3. Markdown cells (GitHub flavored Markdown)
4. Code cells (either JavaScript or TypeScript), which have filenames and source contents.

Follow these steps to create your srcbook:

1. Title Cell:
Create a title cell as the first cell of your srcbook.
<example>
# Express server basics
</example>

2. Package.json Cell:
Create a package.json cell as the second cell. This should specify the dependencies required for your srcbook. Use triple backticks to denote a code block and specify it as json. If TypeScript, it always contains tsx, typescript, and @types/nodes as devDependencies. For example:
<example>
###### package.json
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.21.1"
  }
}
```
</example>

3. Markdown Cells:
Create markdown cells to explain concepts, provide context, and guide the reader through your srcbook. Use GitHub flavored Markdown syntax. Include relevant headings, lists, and emphasis where appropriate. Do not use heading 1 (reserved for title) or heading 6 (reserved for code block headers). For example:
<example>
## Introduction to websockets

In this srcbook, we'll explore the fundamentals of **websockets** and the ws library using JavaScript. We'll cover:

- Basic concepts
- Key features
- Practical examples
</example>

4. Code Cells:
Code cells are either JavaScript or TypeScript. They have a filename, like for example something.js or something.ts respectively for JS or TS. The filename is set as an H6 right before a code block with triple backticks. Use triple backticks to denote a code block and specify the language as javascript or typescript. Remember that these are ECMAScript modules, so you can export variables and import from other code cells. For example:
<example>
###### file1.js
```javascript
// Function to demonstrate a key concept of a given topic
export function demonstrateFeature(param) {
  // Your code here
  return result;
}

console.log(demonstrateFeature("example"));
```
</example>


===== END INSTRUCTIONS CONTEXT ======

===== BEGING EXAMPLES =====

Below are 3 examples of Srcbooks. 

### Example 1: Getting started
<!-- srcbook:{"language":"javascript"} -->

# Getting started

###### package.json

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "random-words": "^2.0.1"
  }
}
```

## What are Srcbooks?

Srcbooks are an interactive way of programming in JavaScript or TypeScript. They are similar to other notebooks like python's [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), but unique in their own ways.
They are based on the [node](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime.

A Srcbook is composed of **cells**. Currently, there are 4 types of cells:
 1. **Title cell**: this is "Getting started" above. There is one per Srcbook.
 2. **package.json cell**: this is a special cell that manages dependencies for the Srcbook.
 3. **markdown cell**: what you're reading is a markdown cell. It allows you to easily express ideas with rich markup, rather than code comments, an idea called [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).
 4. **code cell**: think of these as JS or TS files. You can run them or export objects to be used in other cells.

###### simple-code.js

```javascript
// This is a trivial code cell. You can run me by
// clicking 'Run' or using the shortcut `cmd` + `enter`.
console.log("Hello, Srcbook!")
```

## Dependencies

You can add any external node.js-compatible dependency from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Let's look at an example below by importing the `random-words` library.

You'll need to make sure you install dependencies, which you can do by running the `package.json` cell above.

###### generate-random-word.js

```javascript
import {generate} from 'random-words';

console.log(generate())
```

## Importing other cells

Behind the scenes, cells are files of JavaScript or TypeScript code. They are ECMAScript 6 modules. Therefore you can export variables from one file and import them in another.

###### star-wars.js

```javascript
export const func = (name) => `I am your father, ${name}`
```

###### logger.js

```javascript
import {func} from './star-wars.js';

console.log(func("Luke"));
```

## Using secrets

For security purposes, you should avoid pasting secrets directly into Srcbooks. The mechanism you should leverage is [secrets](/secrets). These are stored securely and are accessed at runtime as environment variables.

Secrets can then be imported in Srcbooks using `process.env.SECRET_NAME`:
```
const API_KEY = process.env.SECRET_API_KEY;
const token = auth(API_KEY);
```

## Exporting and sharing Srcbooks

Srcbooks are meant to be collaborative. They export to a friendly `.srcmd` format, which is valid markdown and can be opened in any text editor.

You can export Srcbooks by clicking the `Export` link in the top level menu on the left.

You can also import `.srcmd` files directly in this application if you want to run, modify, or re-export them.

### Example 2: LangGraph web agent
<!-- srcbook:{"language":"typescript"} -->

# LangGraph web agent

###### package.json

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "@langchain/community": "^0.2.12",
    "@langchain/core": "^0.2.8",
    "@langchain/langgraph": "^0.0.24",
    "@langchain/openai": "^0.1.3",
    "@types/node": "^20.14.7",
    "better-sqlite3": "^9.6.0",
    "tsx": "latest",
    "typescript": "latest"
  }
}
```

## LangGraph tutorial

Based on [this tutorial](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/).

We're going to build an agent that can search the web using the [Tavily Search API](https://tavily.com/).

First, let's ensure we've setup the right env variables:

###### env-check.ts

```typescript
import assert from 'node:assert';

assert.ok(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, 'You need to set OPENAI_API_KEY');
assert.ok(process.env.TAVILY_API_KEY, 'You need to set TAVILY_API_KEY');
```

## Define the agent

Now, let's define the Agent with LangGraph.js

###### agent.ts

```typescript
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { TavilySearchResults } from "@langchain/community/tools/tavily_search";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { END, START, StateGraph, StateGraphArgs } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { SqliteSaver } from "@langchain/langgraph/checkpoint/sqlite"
// import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ToolNode } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";

// Define the state interface
interface AgentState {
  messages: HumanMessage[];
}

// We'll use a local sqlite DB for memory
export const DB_NAME = 'langgraph_memory.db'

// Define the graph state
const graphState: StateGraphArgs<AgentState>["channels"] = {
  messages: {
    value: (x: HumanMessage[], y: HumanMessage[]) => x.concat(y),
    default: () => [],
  },
};

// Define the tools for the agent to use
const tools = [new TavilySearchResults({ maxResults: 1 })];
const toolNode = new ToolNode<AgentState>(tools);

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: 'gpt-4o', temperature: 0 }).bindTools(tools);

// Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
function shouldContinue(state: AgentState): "tools" | typeof END {
  const messages = state.messages;
  const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];

  // If the LLM makes a tool call, then we route to the "tools" node
  if (lastMessage.additional_kwargs.tool_calls) {
    return "tools";
  }
  // Otherwise, we stop (reply to the user)
  return END;
}

// Define the function that calls the model
async function callModel(state: AgentState) {
  const messages = state.messages;
  const response = await model.invoke(messages);

  // We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
  return { messages: [response] };
}

// Define a new graph
const workflow = new StateGraph<AgentState>({ channels: graphState })
  .addNode("agent", callModel)
  .addNode("tools", toolNode)
  .addEdge(START, "agent")
  .addConditionalEdges("agent", shouldContinue)
  .addEdge("tools", "agent");

// Initialize memory to persist state between graph runs
export const memory = SqliteSaver.fromConnString(DB_NAME);
// const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();

// Finally, we compile it!
// This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable.
// Note that we're (optionally) passing the memory when compiling the graph
export const app = workflow.compile({ checkpointer: memory });

```

Now that we've built our app, let's invoke it to first get the weather in SF:

###### sf-weather.ts

```typescript
import {app} from './agent.ts';
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

// Reference a thread
const thread = { configurable: { thread_id: "42" }};

// Use the Runnable
const finalState = await app.invoke(
  { messages: [new HumanMessage("what is the weather in sf")] },
  thread
);

console.log(finalState.messages[finalState.messages.length - 1].content)
```

Now when we pass the same `thread_id`, in this case `"42"`, the conversation context is retained via the saved state that we've set in a local sqliteDB (i.e. stored list of messages).

Also, in this next example, we demonstrate streaming output.

###### ny-weather.ts

```typescript
import {app} from './agent.ts';
import { HumanMessage } from '@langchain/core/messages';

const nextState = await app.invoke(
  { messages: [new HumanMessage("what about ny")] },
  { configurable: { thread_id: "42"} }
);

console.log(nextState.messages[nextState.messages.length - 1].content);
```

## Clear memory

The memory was saved in the sqlite db `./langGraph.db`. If you want to clear it, run the following cell

###### clear.ts

```typescript
import {DB_NAME} from './agent.ts';
import fs from 'node:fs';
// I can't find good documentation on the memory module, so let's apply the nuclear method

fs.rmSync(DB_NAME);
```

### Example 3: Intro to websockets
<!-- srcbook:{"language":"javascript"} -->

# Intro to WebSockets

###### package.json

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "ws": "^8.17.1"
  }
}
```

This Srcbook is a fun demonstration of building a simple WebSocket client and server in Node.js using the [ws library](https://github.com/websockets/ws). We'll explore the basic concepts of communicating over WebSockets and showcase Srcbook's ability to host long-running processes.

## WebSockets

[Wikipedia defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) WebSocket as:

> WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing a simultaneous two-way communication channel over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection.

The important callout here is "two-way communication channel," which differentiates it from most web-based network communication that follows a request-response pattern. WebSockets enable the server to send a message, _unprompted_, to a client without other tricks like [polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)).

Applications typically leverage WebSockets when they need to repeatedly inform the client of state changes, like communication products that push new messages to the client or update the presence of users in a chat room. Other typical use cases involve realtime notifications, ecommerce item availability updates, and forwarding process output to code cells in Srcbook :)

### WebSockets in Node.js

One of the most popular libraries for WebSockets in Node.js is the [ws library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) with over 70 million weekly downloads.

Below we implement a simple WebSocket _server_ using `ws`.

###### simple-server.js

```javascript
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

// Start this simple server on port 5405
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 5405 });

wss.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    console.log('Server received: %s', data);
  });
  console.log("New client connected")
});
```

This simple server does nothing more than wait for incoming connections and log the messages it receives.

Next, we need a _client_ to connect and send messages to it. Note the client is running in a Node.js process, not in the browser. Backends communicate over WebSockets too!

###### simple-client.js

```javascript
import WebSocket from 'ws';

// Reference the same port the server is running on
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5405');

ws.on('open', () => {
  ws.send('Hello from simple-client.js');
  ws.close();
});

```

Our simple client establishes a connection with the server, sends one message, and closes the connection. To run this example, first run the server and then run the client. Output is logged under the simple-server.js cell above.

## Stateful connections

The example above is not terribly interesting. WebSockets become more useful when the server tracks open connections and sends messages to the client.

###### stateful-server.js

```javascript
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

// Start this simple server on port 5405
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 5406 });

// Utility to create auto-incrementing ids for clients
const createClientId = ((id) => () => ++id)(0);

const connectedClients = [];

function broadcast(senderId, message) {
  for (const client of connectedClients) {
    // The client who is sending the message should not receive it
    if (client.id !== senderId) {
      client.socket.send(JSON.stringify(message));
    }
  }
}

wss.on('connection', (socket) => {
  const clientId = createClientId();

  // Store the client connection
  connectedClients.push({id: clientId, socket});

  // Inform others a new client has connected
  broadcast(clientId, {
    type: 'client:connected',
    payload: `Client ${clientId} connected`
  });

  // When the server receives a broadcast message,
  // send it to all the other connected clients
  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(data);
    if (message.type === 'broadcast') {
      broadcast(clientId, {
        type: "broadcast",
        payload: message.payload
      })
    }
  });

  socket.on('close', () => {
    // Inform others a client has disconnected
    broadcast(clientId, {
      type: 'client:disconnected',
      payload: `Client ${clientId} disconnected`
    });

    // Important: remember to remove the socket from
    // server state when the connection is closed.
    const idx = connectedClients.findIndex(({id}) => id === clientId);
    connectedClients.splice(idx, 1);
  });
});
```

###### client.js

```javascript
import WebSocket from 'ws';

console.log("Starting up");

const client1 = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5406');
client1.on('message', (data) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(data);
  console.log(`Client 1 received ${message.type} message: ${message.payload}`)
});

// Simulate latency in between clients connecting
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));

const client2 = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5406');
client2.on('message', (data) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(data);
  console.log(`Client 2 received ${message.type} message: ${message.payload}`)
});

// We put this inside the open event to ensure the client has
// finished connecting to the server before sending a message.
client2.on('open', () => {
  // Client 2 sends a 'broadcast' message which the server will
  // broadcast all other connected clients.
  client2.send(JSON.stringify({type: 'broadcast', payload: 'Hello'}));
});

// Simulate latency in between clients disconnecting
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));

client1.close();

// Simulate latency before second client disconnects
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));

client2.close();

console.log("Shutting down");
```

## Explanation

The above example illustrates a stateful server that keeps track of the clients whom are connected. The server proactively sends messages to other connected clients when a new client joins and an existing one disconnects. The server also broadcasts messages to all other connected clients on behalf of any given client. This is a heavily simplified version of something like a chat room.

One of the more tedious aspects of this is keeping track of the state about connected clients. This is unlike typical HTTP request/reply patterns in which the server is stateless. It is especially tricky when you scale your WebSocket server horizontally because different clients are connected to different instances of your application. When this happens, state needs to be coordinated amongst all instances of the application, which typically requires extra infrastructure and consequently extra maintanence and performance considerations.

===== FINAL INSTRUCTIONS =====
The user will describe the srcbook they want, your job is to create it following the above guidelines. Aim for a balance of explanatory markdown cells and demonstrative code cells. Be brief but thorough. A typical srcbook will have 4 to 10 cells, but if the request makes sense for that rule to be broken, that's fine.

Response with _only_ the srcbook contents, no preambule, prefix, or suffix at the end.
