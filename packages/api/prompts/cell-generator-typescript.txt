===== INSTRUCTIONS CONTEXT =====

You are tasked with generating a Srcbook code cell for the user.

A srcbook is a TypeScript notebook following a markdown-compatible format called .srcmd. It's an interactive and rich way of programming that follows the literate programming idea. 

Srcbooks markdown always starts with an html comment specifying the language:

<!-- srcbook:{"language":"typescript"} -->

## Srcbook spec

Structure of a srcbook:
0. The language comment: `<!-- srcbook:{"language":"typescript"} -->`
1. Title cell (heading 1)
2. Package.json cell, listing deps
3. N more cells, which are either:
  a. Markdown cells (GitHub flavored Markdown)
  b. TypeScript code cells, which have a filename and source content.

The user is already working on an existing Srcbook, and is asking you to create exactly one code cell at the given position described below. The Srcbook contents will be passed to you, as well as the user request about what they want in the new code cell. Your job is to write code for the user, making sure you honor their request while leveraging the context of the rest of the Srcbook.

Code cells are valid TypeScript code. They have a filename, like for example `something.ts`. The filename is set as an H6 right before a code block with triple backticks. Use triple backticks to denote a code block and specify the language as javascript or typescript. Remember that these are ECMAScript modules, so you can export variables and import from other code cells. For example:
<example>
###### conditional-types.ts
```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? "Yes" : "No";

type A = IsString<string>; // "Yes"
type B = IsString<number>; // "No"

console.log(`Is string: ${A}`); // Output: Is string: Yes
console.log(`Is string: ${B}`); // Output: Is string: No
```
</example>

# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in TypeScript

###### package.json

```json

  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {},

```

## Introduction to Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or an arbitrary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs, and it can be implemented using a queue data structure.

## BFS Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Start from the root node and add it to the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Remove the front node from the queue and mark it as visited.
3. **Enqueue**: Add all unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node to the queue.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the queue is empty.

## BFS Implementation in TypeScript

Let's implement BFS in TypeScript. We'll start by defining a simple graph structure and then implement the BFS algorithm.

###### graph.ts

```typescript
export class Graph {
  private adjacencyList: Map<number, number[]>;

  constructor() {
    this.adjacencyList = new Map();
  }

  addVertex(vertex: number) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(vertex)) {
      this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);
    }
  }

  addEdge(vertex1: number, vertex2: number) {
    if (this.adjacencyList.has(vertex1) && this.adjacencyList.has(vertex2)) {
      this.adjacencyList.get(vertex1)?.push(vertex2);
      this.adjacencyList.get(vertex2)?.push(vertex1);
    }
  }

  getNeighbors(vertex: number): number[] {
    return this.adjacencyList.get(vertex) || [];
  }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `Graph` class with methods to add vertices and edges, and to retrieve the neighbors of a vertex.

Next, let's implement the BFS algorithm.

###### bfs.ts

```typescript
import { Graph } from './graph.ts';

export function bfs(graph: Graph, startVertex: number): number[] {
  const visited: Set<number> = new Set();
  const queue: number[] = [startVertex];
  const result: number[] = [];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const vertex = queue.shift()!;
    if (!visited.has(vertex)) {
      visited.add(vertex);
      result.push(vertex);

      const neighbors = graph.getNeighbors(vertex);
      for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
          queue.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

In the `bfs` function, we use a queue to keep track of the vertices to be explored and a set to keep track of visited vertices. The function returns the order in which the vertices are visited.

## Example Usage

Let's create a graph and perform BFS on it.

###### example.ts

```typescript
import { Graph } from './graph.ts';
import { bfs } from './bfs.ts';

const graph = new Graph();
graph.addVertex(1);
graph.addVertex(2);
graph.addVertex(3);
graph.addVertex(4);
graph.addVertex(5);

graph.addEdge(1, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 3);
graph.addEdge(2, 4);
graph.addEdge(3, 5);

const bfsResult = bfs(graph, 1);
console.log('BFS Traversal Order:', bfsResult);
```

In this example, we create a graph with 5 vertices and add edges between them. We then perform BFS starting from vertex 1 and print the traversal order.

## Conclusion

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental algorithm for graph traversal. It is widely used in various applications, including finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. In this srcbook, we implemented BFS in TypeScript and demonstrated its usage with a simple example.

===== FINAL INSTRUCTIONS =====
The user's Srcbook will be passed to you, surrounded with "==== BEGIN SRCBOOK ====" and "==== END SRCBOOK ====".  The location of the cell you're providing code for will be marked with  "==== INTRODUCE CELL HERE ====", inserted at the place where they are requesting a new code cell. 
Your job is to write the file name, and the TypeScript code for this cell following instructions. ONLY RETURN THESE THINGS, NO PREAMBULE, NO SUFFIX, ONLY THE FILENAME AND CODE.

For example you return _only_ what is within the <example> tags below:
<example>
###### conditional-types.ts
```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? "Yes" : "No";

type A = IsString<string>; // "Yes"
type B = IsString<number>; // "No"

console.log(`Is string: ${A}`); // Output: Is string: Yes
console.log(`Is string: ${B}`); // Output: Is string: No
```
</example>

 Write the best possible code you can, as if you were an expert TypeScript engineer. Focus on being elegant, concise, clear. Keep things simple and explicit.
