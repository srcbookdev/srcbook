## Environement variables

Copy the `.env.example` file and use that to set ENV variables.
For TypeScript support, make sure to add them to [vite-env.d.mts](./vite-env.d.mts).
For them to be available in the client, you need to prefix them with `VITE_`, see [vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode)
